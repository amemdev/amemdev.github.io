          This page looks a lot like the first website I made using Netscape Composer. I picked up programming around age 10 in the 90s. Studied computer science at uni in my teens.
          Did the bare minimum for most of it. Felt tired a lot. Cycled through a few dev roles. Nothing to write home about. I'm in my mid 30s now. My primary language is PHP.
          I don't know how I feel about that. I wish it were C# or Java or Ruby or Python.

          I have a constant sense of wanting to make up for lost opportunities. Nothing ever gets done about it, of course.

          I tried multiple times to teach myself Ruby on Rails in 2008. I'd get through the first few chapters of that Pragmatic book then get distracted. In hindsight, I should've learnt
          just enough to get a job and then continued learning on the job. Lost opportunity.

          I'm not sure if web dev is a very magical area of computing at this point. It's practical and seems to pay well, but there's no sense of discovery in it for me. It's hard to care about js frameworks.

          <blockquote>
            Follow your bliss. If you do follow your bliss,
you put yourself on a kind of track
that has been there all the while waiting for you,
and the life you ought to be living
is the one you are living.
When you can see that,
you begin to meet people
who are in the field of your bliss,
and they open the doors to you.
I say, follow your bliss and don't be afraid,
and doors will open
where you didn't know they were going to be.
If you follow your bliss,
doors will open for you that wouldn't have opened for anyone else.<br /><br />

          I'd like to follow my bliss. Abandon my plans to work towards getting employed by a big bank. Maybe something like <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/">this</a> or
          <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/">this</a> or <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">this</a> might rekindle that curiosity and sense of adventure I felt about computers at age 10.
          I aim to document my findings here.
